Tetris Application made in Visual Studio Forms

!Flasing Lights Warning!
Due to the nature of the control I used for displaying the game it flashes every update (more on it later).

I made it for a local school hosted game jam and got first place.
Visual Studio Forms is not made for making games but in the competitions rules it was requiered to be used as a template for the game so I tried anyways and got a really good experience and knowledge about classes out of it.
I had to use .Net Frameworks Drawing Canvas for displaying the game in real time sience there was no other control that would let me visually display a game like tetris or so I tought at the time (if there was an alternative I could have saved myself a lot of time).
Almost every component of the game is in its own class and the blocks all have a parent apstract class that they derive from and that was really interesting to play with and code.

Most Important Features: Hold a piece, Preview next piece, Harddrop, Softdrop...

Here are some screenshots from the game (you can also try it out by downloading the repository and launching "Tetris.exe")
